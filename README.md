# Eclipse uProtocol Rust vsomeip Client

## Overview

This library implements a uTransport client for vsomeip in Rust following the uProtocol [uTransport Specifications](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/up-l1/README.adoc).

## Getting Started

### Building the Library

To build the library, run:
```bash
VSOMEIP_INSTALL_PATH=<path/to/where/to/install/vsomeip> GENERIC_CPP_STDLIB_PATH=<path/to/generic/cpp/stdlib> ARCH_SPECIFIC_CPP_STDLIB_PATH=<path/to/arch_specific/cpp/stdlib> cargo build
```

in the project root directory.

See `vsomeip-sys/README.md` for more details on options.

This library leverages the [up-rust](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-rust) library for data types and models specified by uProtocol.

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, run
```bash
 VSOMEIP_INSTALL_PATH= <path/to/vsomeip/install> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path/to/vsomeip/install>/lib  GENERIC_CPP_STDLIB_PATH=<path/to/generic/cpp/stdlib> ARCH_SPECIFIC_CPP_STDLIB_PATH=<path/to/arch_specific/cpp/stdlib> cargo test -- --test-threads 1
```

Breaking this down:
* Details about the environment variables can be found in `vsomeip-sys/README.md`. Please reference there for further detail.
* We need to pass in `-- --test-threads 1` because the tests refer to the same configurations and will fall over if they are run simultaneously. So we instruct to use a single thread, i.e. run the tests in serial.

### Using the Library

The library contains the following modules:

Package | [uProtocol spec](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec) | Purpose
---|---|---
transport | [uP-L1 Specifications](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-spec/blob/main/up-l1/README.adoc) | Implementation of vsomeip uTransport client used for bidirectional point-2-point communication between uEs.
